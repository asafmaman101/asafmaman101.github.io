I'm a Computer Vision and Deep Learning researcher.
MSc in Computer Science from Tel Aviv University under
the supervision of [Nadav Cohen](https://www.cohennadav.com).

My research interests include generalization of
Deep Neural Networks, applications to Computer Vision tasks.
I'm also interested in other fields and applications of Machine Learning
(NLP, classical ML methods, NLP, etc.).
